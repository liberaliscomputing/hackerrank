    "### Objective \n",
    "In this challenge, we practice calculating the probability of a compound event. We recommend you review today's [Probability Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-1/tutorial) before attempting this challenge.\n",

    "+ Urn *Y* contains *5* red balls and *4* black balls.\n",
    "+ Urn *Z* contains *4* red balls and *4* black balls. \n",
    "\n",
    "One ball is drawn from each of the *3* urns. What is the probability that, of the *3* balls drawn, *2* are red and *1* is black?\n",
