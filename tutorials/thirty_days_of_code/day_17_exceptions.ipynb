    "## Day-17: More Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective \n",
    "Yesterday's challenge taught you to manage exceptional situations by using *try* and *catch* blocks. In today's challenge, you're going to practice throwing and propagating an exception. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-more-exceptions/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "Write a *Calculator* class with a single method: `int power(int, int)`. The *power* method takes two integers, *n* and *p*, as parameters and returns the integer result of `n**p`. If either *n* or *p* is negative, then the method must throw an exception with the message: `n and p should be non-negative`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Do not use an access modifier (e.g.: public) in the declaration for your *Calculator* class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format\n",
    "Input from stdin is handled for you by the locked stub code in your editor. The first line contains an integer, *T*, the number of test cases. Each of the *T* subsequent lines describes a test case in *2* space-separated integers denoting *n* and *p*, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "+ No Test Case will result in overflow for correctly written code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format\n",
    "Output to stdout is handled for you by the locked stub code in your editor. There are *T* lines of output, where each line contains the result of `N**P` as calculated by your *Calculator* class' power method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input\n",
    "```python\n",
    "4\n",
    "3 5\n",
    "2 4\n",
    "-1 -2\n",
    "-1 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Output\n",
    "```python\n",
    "243\n",
    "16\n",
    "n and p should be non-negative\n",
    "n and p should be non-negative\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "`T = 4`  \n",
    "*T0*: *3* and *5* are positive, so *power* returns the result of `3**5`, which is *243*.  \n",
    "*T1*: *2* and *4* are positive, so *power* returns the result of `2**4`, which is *16*.   \n",
    "*T2*: Both inputs (*-1* and *-2*) are negative, so *power* throws an exception and `n and p should be non-negative` is printed.  \n",
    "*T3*: One of the inputs (*-1*) is negative, so *power* throws an exception and `n and p should be non-negative` is printed.\n",
