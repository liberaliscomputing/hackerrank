    "## Day-18: Queues and Stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Welcome to Day 18! Today we're learning about Stacks and Queues. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-queues-stacks/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "A *palindrome* is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backwards and forwards. Can you determine if a given string, *s*, is a palindrome?\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this challenge, we must first take each character in *s*, *enqueue* it in a *queue*, and also *push* that same character onto a *stack*. Once that's done, we must *dequeue* the first character from the *queue* and *pop* the top character off the *stack*, then compare the two characters to see if they are the same; as long as the characters match, we continue dequeueing, popping, and comparing each character until our containers are empty (a non-match means *s* isn't a palindrome).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the following declarations and implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Two instance variables: one for your *stack*, and one for your *queue*.\n",
    "2. A `void pushCharacter(char ch)` method that pushes a character onto a stack.\n",
    "3. A `void enqueueCharacter(char ch)` method that enqueues a character in the *queue* instance variable.\n",
    "4. A `char popCharacter()` method that pops and returns the character at the top of the *stack* instance variable.\n",
    "5. A `char dequeueCharacter()` method that dequeues and returns the first character in the *queue* instance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format\n",
    "You *do not* need to read anything from stdin. The locked stub code in your editor reads a single line containing string *s*. It then calls the methods specified above to pass each character to your instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "+ *s* is composed of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format\n",
    "You are *not* responsible for printing any output to stdout.  \n",
    "If your code is correctly written and *s* is a palindrome, the locked stub code will print `The word, s, is a palindrome.`; otherwise, it will print `The word, s, is not a palindrome.`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Input\n",
    "```python\n",
    "racecar\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Output\n",
    "```python\n",
    "The word, racecar, is a palindrome.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
